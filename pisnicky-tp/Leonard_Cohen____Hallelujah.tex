Now I've <C>heard there was a <Ami>secret chord

That <C>David played to <Ami>please the Lord

But <F>you don't really <G>care for music, <C>do you? <G>

It <C>goes like this, the <F>fourth, the <G>fifth

The <Ami>minor fall, the <F>major lift

The <G>baffled king com<E>posing Halle<Ami>lujah

Halle<F>lujah, Halle<Ami>lujah, Halle<F>lujah

Halle<C>lu <G>– <C>jah <G>

Your faith was strong but you needed proof

You saw her bathing on the roof

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

She tied you to a kitchen chair

She broke your throne, and she cut your hair

And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain

Though I don't even know the name

But if I did, well really, what's it to you?

There's a blaze of light in every word

It doesn't matter which you heard:

The holy or the broken Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much

I couldn't feel so I tried to touch

I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you

And even though it all went wrong

I'll stand before the Lord of Song

With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

It's been a <C>hard <F>day's <C>night, and I've been <B>working like a <C>dog

It's been a hard <F>day's <C>night, I should be <B>sleeping like a <C>log

But when I <F>get home to you, I find the <G7>things that you do

Will make me <C>feel <F>al<C>right

You know I work all day, to get you money to buy you things

And it's worth it just to hear you say, you're gonna give me everything

So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone

You know I'll be okay

When I'm <Emi>home, <Ami>everything seems to be <Emi>right

When I'm <C>home, <Ami>feeling you holding me <F>tight, <G>tight, yeah

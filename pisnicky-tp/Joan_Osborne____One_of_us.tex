If God had a name, what would it be? And would you

Call it to his face if you were faced with him

In all his glory? What would you ask if you had just one question?

<C>Yeah, yeah, <D>God is great, <C>yeah, yeah, <D>God is good, <C>yeah, yeah, <D>yeah

What if God was one of us?

Just a slob like one of us?

Just a stranger on the bus

Trying to make his way home?

If God had a face, what would it look like? And would

You want to see, if seeing meant that you would

Have to believe in things like heaven and in 

Jesus and the saints and all the prophets?

Yeah, yeah, God is great, yeah, yeah, God is good, yeah, yeah, yeah

What if God was one of us?  Just a slob like one of us?

Just a stranger on the bus trying to make his way home?

Trying to make his way home…  Like up to heaven all alone…

Nobody calling on the phone…  Except for the Pope maybe in Rome

Yeah, yeah, God is great, yeah, yeah, God is good, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

What if God was one of us?  Just a slob like one of us?

Just a stranger on the bus trying to make his way home?

Just trying to make his way home…
Like a holy rolling stone…

Back up to heaven all alone…
Just trying to make his way home…

Nobody calling on the phone…
Except for the Pope maybe in Rome

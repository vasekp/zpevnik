[Dmi]Are you going to [C]Scarborough [Dmi]Fair?
[F]Parsley, [Dmi]sage, rose[F G]mary and [Dmi]thyme
Remember [F]me to one [C]who [Dmi]lives [C]there
[Dmi]She once [C]was [Dmi]a\ \ \ [ C]true [Dmi]love [C]of [Dmi]mine

\sloka
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Without no seams nor needle work
Then she’ll be a true love of mine

\sloka
Tell her to find me an acre of land
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Between the salt water and the sea strands
Then she’ll be a true love of mine

\sloka
Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
Then she’ll be a true love of mine

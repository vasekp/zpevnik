[A]25 years of my life and still [A2]
[Hmi]Trying to get up that great big hill [Hmi4\ D]of hope 
For a [D2]desti[A]nation [A2]
I [A]realized quickly when I knew I should [A2]
That the [Hmi]world was made up of this brotherhood [Hmi4\ D]of man, 
For wha[D2]tever that [A]means. [A2]

And so I cry sometimes when I’m lying in bed 
Just to get it all out what is in my head, then I, 
I’m feeling, a little peculiar. 
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside 
And I take a deep breath, and I get real high, and I, 
Scream from the top of my lungs, “What is going on?”
And I say, “Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah”
I said, “Hey, what’s going on?”
And I say, “Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah”
I said, “Hey, what’s going on?”

And I try, oh my God, do I try 
I try all the time, in this institution. 
And I pray, oh my God, do I pray 
I pray for single day, for a revolution.

And so I cry sometimes…
And I say…
And I say…

For a destination.

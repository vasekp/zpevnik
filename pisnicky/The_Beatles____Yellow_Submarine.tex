[D]In the [A]town where [G]I was [D]born
[Hmi]Lived a [Emi]man who [G]sailed the [A]sea
[D]And he [A]told us [G]of his [D]life
[Hmi]In the [Emi]land of [G]subma[A]rines

So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

Yellow submarine, [D]yellow submarine. :|
And our [A]friends are [G]all on [D]board

[D]And the [A]band be[G]gins to [D]play. [Hmi Emi A7 D]

Every one of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine

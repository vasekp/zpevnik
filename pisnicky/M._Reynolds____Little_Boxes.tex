\sloka
Little [G]boxes on the hillside
Little [C]boxes made of [G]ticky-tacky
Little boxes, little [C]boxes
Little [G]boxes, all the [D]same
There’s a [G]green one and a pink one
And a [C]blue one and a [G]yellow one
And they’re all made out of [C]ticky-tacky
And they [G]all look [D]just the [G]same

\sloka
And the people in the houses
All go to the university
And they all get put in boxes
Little boxes, all the same
And there’s doctors and there’s lawyers
And business executives
And they’re all made out of ticky-tacky
And they all look just the same

\sloka
And they all play on the golf-course
And drink their Martini dry
And they all have pretty children
And the children go to school
And the children go to summer camp
And then to the university
And they all get put in boxes
And they all come out the same

\sloka
And the boys go into business
And marry, and raise a family
And they all get put in boxes
Little boxes, all the same
There’s a green one and a pink one
And a blue one and a yellow one
And they’re all made out of ticky-tacky
And they all look just the same

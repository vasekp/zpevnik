\pisen{Herman’s Hermits}{No Milk Today}

\sloka
[Ami]No milk today, my [C]love is gone away
The [E]bottle stands for[Ami]lorn, a [E]symbol of the [Ami]dawn
No milk today, it [C]seems a common sight
But [E]people passing [Ami]by. Don’t [E]know the reason [Ami]why

[A]How could they know just [G]what this message means
The [D]end of all my hopes, the end of [E]all my [A]dreams
How could they know, a [G]palace there had been
[D]behind the door where my love [E]reigned as [A]queen

[Ami]No milk today, it [C]wasn’t always so
The [E]company was [Ami]gay, we [E]turn’d night into [Ami]day

\ref
[A]But all that’s [E]left is a [D]place dark and [E]lonely
[A]A terraced [E]house in a [D]mean street back of town
[A]Becomes a [E]shrine when I [D]think of you [E]only
[D]Just two up two [E]down

\sloka
No milk today, it wasn’t always so
The company was gay, we turn’d night into day
As music played the faster did we dance
We felt it both at once, the start of our romance

How could they know just what this message means
The end of all my hopes, the end of all my dreams
How could they know a palace there had been
behind the door where my love reigned as queen

No milk today, my love is gone away
The bottle stands forlorn, a symbol of the dawn

\ref
But all…

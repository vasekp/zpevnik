[Ami]Sunny [C7]
Yesterday my [F]life was filled with [E7]rain
[Ami]Sunny [C7]
You smiled at me and [F]really eased the [E7]pain
Now the [Ami]dark days are gone, and the [C7]bright days are here
[F]My sunny one shines [Dmi]so sin[E]cere
[Ami]Sunny one so [E7]true, I love [Ami]you

Sunny
Thank you for the sunshine bouquet
Sunny
Thank you for the love you brought my way
You gave to me your all and all
And now I feel ten feet tall
Sunny one so true, I love you

Sunny
Thank you for the truth you let me see
Sunny
Thank you for the facts from A to Z
My life was torn like wind-blown sand
And a rock was formed when you held my hand
Sunny one so true, I love you.

Sunny
Thank you for the smile upon your face
Hmm, sunny
Thank you, thank you for the gleam that shows its grace
You're my spark of nature's fire
You're my sweet complete desire
Sunny one so true, yes, I love you

\sloka
[Abmi]Time, it needs time to win back your love again
I will be [B]there, I will be [Eb]there
[Abmi]Love, only love can bring back your love someday
I will be [B]there, I will be [Eb]there

\sloka
Fight, babe, I’ll fight to win back your love again
I will be there, I will be there
Love, only love can break down the walls someday
I will be there, I will be there

[Abmi]If we’d [E]go again
[H]All the way from the [F#]start
[Abmi]I would [E]try to change
The [H]things that killed our [F#]love
[Abmi]Your pride has [Dbmi]build a wall
So [Eb]strong that I can’t get [Abmi]through
Is there [E]really no chance
To [F#]start once again?
I’m still loving [Abmi]you

\sloka
Try, baby try to trust in my love again
I will be there, I will be there
Love, only love just shouldn’t be thrown away
I will be there, I will be there

\ref
If we’d…
Yes I’ve hurt your pride
And I know what you’ve been through
You should give me a chance
This can’t be the end
I’m still loving you

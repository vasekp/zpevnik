\sloka
There [Ami]is a [C]house in [D]New Orleans [F]
They [Ami]call the [C]Rising [E]Sun
And it’s [Ami]been the [C]ruin of [D]many a poor [F]boy
And [Ami]God I [E]know I’m [Ami]one [E]

My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new bluejeans
My father was a gamblin’ man
Down in New Orleans

\sloka
Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and trunk
And the only time he’s satisfied
Is when he’s on drunk

\sloka
Oh mother tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun

\sloka
Well, I got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
I’m goin’ back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

\sloka
Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it’s been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God I know I’m one

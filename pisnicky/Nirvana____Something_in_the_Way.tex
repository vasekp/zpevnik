\pisen{Nirvana}{Something in the Way}

\sloka
[Ami]Underneath the [F]bridge
The [Ami]tarp has sprung a [F]leak
And the [Ami]animals I’ve [F]trapped
Have [Ami]all become my [F]pets
And I’m [Ami]living off of [F]grass
And the [Ami]drippings from the [F]ceiling
[Ami]It’s okay to eat [F]fish
’Cause they [Ami]don’t have any [F]feelings

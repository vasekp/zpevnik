\pisen{Chantal Kreviazuk}{Leaving on a Jet Plane}

\sloka
All my [D]bags are packed, I’m [G]ready to go
I’m [D]standing here out[G]side your door
I [D]hate to wake you [G]up to say good[A]bye
But the [D]dawn is breakin’, it’s [G]early morn
The [D]taxi’s waitin’, he’s [G]blowin’ his horn
Al[D]ready I’m so [G]lonesome I could [A]cry

\ref
So [D]kiss me and [G]smile for me
[D]Tell me that you’ll [G]wait for me
[D]Hold me like you’ll [G]never let me [A]go
I’m [D]leavin’ [G]on a jet plane
I [D]don’t know when [G]I’ll be back again
[D]Oh, [G]babe, I hate [A]to go

\sloka
There’s so many times I’ve let you down
So many times I’ve played around
I tell you now, they don’t mean a thing
Every place I go, I’ll think of you
Every song I sing, I’ll sing for you
When I come back, I’ll wear your wedding ring

\ref
So kiss me…

\sloka
Now the time has come to leave you
One more time, let me kiss you
Then close your eyes, I’ll be on my way
Dream about the days to come
When I won’t have to leave alone
About the times, I won’t have to say

\ref
So kiss me…

\pisen{Limp Bizkit}{Behind Blue Eyes}

\sloka
[Emi]No one knows what it’s [G]like
To be the [D]bad man
To be the [C]sad man
Be[A]hind blue eyes
And [Emi]no one knows what it’s [G]like to be [D]hated
To be [C]fated to telling [A]only lies

\ref
But my [C]dreams [D]they aren’t as [G]empty
As my [C]conscience [D]seems to [E4/Emi]be
I have [Hmi]hours, only [C]lonely
My love is [D]vengeance
That’s never [A]free

\sloka
No one knows what it’s like
To feel these feelings
Like I do, and I blame you!
No one bites back as hard
On their anger
None of my pain and woe
Can show through

\ref
But my dreams…

\sloka
No one knows what it’s like
To be mistreated, to be defeated
Behind blue eyes
No one knows how to say
That they’re sorry and don’t worry
I’m not telling lies

\ref
But my dreams…

\sloka
No one knows what it’s like
To be the bad man, to be the sad man
Behind blue eyes

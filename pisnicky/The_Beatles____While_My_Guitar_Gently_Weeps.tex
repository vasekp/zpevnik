\pisen{The Beatles}{While My Guitar Gently Weeps}

[*Ami Ami/G Ami/F# Ami/F Ami G Ami]

\sloka
I [Ami]look at you [Ami/G]all, see the [Ami/F#]love there that is [Ami/F]sleeping
[Ami]While my [G]guitar gently [D]weeps [E]
I [Ami]look at the [Ami/G]floor, and I [Ami/F#]see it needs [Ami/F]sweeping
[Ami]Still my [G]guitar gently [C]weeps [E]

\ref
[A]I don't know [C#mi]why \quad [F#mi]nobody [C#mi]told you
[Hmi]How to unfold your [E]love
[A]I don't know [C#mi]how \quad [F#mi]someone con[C#mi]trolled you
[Hmi]They bought and sold [E]you

\sloka
I look at the world, and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

\ref
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how      you were inverted
No one alerted you

\sloka
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all...
Still my guitar gently weeps

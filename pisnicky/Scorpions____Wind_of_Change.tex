\pisen{Scorpions}{Wind of Change}

\sloka
[C]I follow the Mosk[Dmi]va
Down to Gorky [C]Park
Listening to the [Dmi]wind of [Ami]chan[G]ge
[C]An August summer [Dmi]night
Soldiers passing [C]by
Listening to the [Dmi]wind of [Ami]chan[G]ge

\sloka
The world closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers
The futureâ€™s in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

\ref
[C]Take [G]me to the [Dmi]magic of the [G7]moment
On a [C]glory [G]night
Where the [Dmi]children of to[G]morrow dream [Ami]away
In the wind of [G]change

\sloka
Walking down the street
Distant memories
Are buried in the past forever
I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

\ref
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change

\hvezda
[Ami]The wind of change blows [G]straight
Into the face of [Ami]time
Like a stormwind that will [G]ring
The freedom bell for peace of [C]mind
Let your balalaika [Dmi]sing
What my guitar wants to [E]say

\ref
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change

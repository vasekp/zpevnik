\sloka
I [E]saw him dancin’ there by the record machine
I knew he must have been about seven[H]teen
The [A]beat was goin’ [H]strong, [E]playin’ my favourite [A]song
|: And I could [H]tell it wouldn’t be [A]long
Till he was with [H]me, yeah me :|
Singin’

\ref
[E]I love rock’n’roll [G]
So [A]put another dime in the [H]jukebox, baby
[E]I love rock’n’roll [G]
So [A]come an’ take your time and [H]dance [A]with [E]me

\sloka
He smiled so I got up an’ asked for his name
That don’t matter, he said, ’cause it’s all the same
Soon I’ll take you home where we can be alone
An’ next we were movin’ on
He was with me, yeah me
Playin’ around and singing the same old song
Yeah with me
Singin’

\ref
I love rock’n’roll…

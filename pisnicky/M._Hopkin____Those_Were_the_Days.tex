\pisen{M. Hopkin}{Those Were the Days}

\sloka
[Emi]Once upon a time there was a tavern
[E7]Where we used to raise a glass or [Ami]two
Remember how we laughed away the [Emi]hours
And [H7]think of all the great things we would do

\ref
Those were the [Emi]days, my friend
We thought they’d [Ami]never end
We’d sing and [D]dance for ever and a [G]day
We’d live the [Ami]life we choose
We’d fight and [Emi]never lose
For we were [H7]young and sure to have our [Emi]way
[Emi Ami D G Ami Emi H7 Emi]La la la la la la…

\sloka
Then the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way
If by chance I’d see you in the tavern
We’d smile at one another and we’d say

\ref
Those were the days, my friend…

\sloka
Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me?

\ref
Those were the days, my friend…

\sloka
Through the door there came familiar laughter
I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh, my friend, we’re older but no wiser
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same

\ref
Those were the days, my friend…

\pisen{Deep Purple}{Soldier of Fortune}

\sloka
I have [Gmi]often told you stories a[F]bout the way
I [Gmi]lived the life of a drifter [Dmi]waiting for the day
When I’d [Gmi]take your hand and sing you songs
Then [F]maybe you would say
[Gmi]Come lay with me love me
[Dmi]And I would surely stay

\ref
[B]But I [C]feel I’m growing [Gmi]older
[Eb]And the [F]songs that I have [B]sung
[D7]Echo in the [Gmi]distance
Like the [F]sound
Of a [B]windmill goin’[Eb]round
I [Cmi]guess I’ll always [Dmi]be
A soldier of [Gmi]fortune

\sloka
Many times I’ve been a traveller
I looked for something new
In days of old when nights were cold
I wandered without you
But those days I thougt my eyes
Had seen you standing near
Though blindness is confusing
It shows that you’re not here

\ref
Now I feel I’m growing older…
Yes, [Gmi]I can hear the [F]sound of a [B]windmill goin’[Eb]round
I [Cmi]guess I’ll always [Dmi]be a soldier of [Gmi]fortune

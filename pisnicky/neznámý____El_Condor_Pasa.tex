\pisen{}{El Condor Pasa}

\sloka
I’d [Ami]rather be a sparrow than a [C]snail
Yes I would, if I could, I surely [Ami]would
I’d rather be a hammer than a [C]nail
Yes I would, if I only could, I surely [Ami]would

\ref
A[F]way, I’d rather sail away
Like a [C]swan that’s here and gone
A [F]man gets tied up to the ground
He gives the [C]world its saddest sound
Its saddest [Ami]sound

\sloka
I’d rather be a forest than a street
Yes I would, if I could, I surely would
I’d rather feel the earth beneath my feet
Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would

\ref
Away…

Daddy is a doctor, mother is a debutante
Pillars of socie[G7]ty
Living in a mansion somewhere in the country
And another in Chel[C]sea
Freedom is a rich girl, daddie’s little sweet girl
Pretty as a sunny [G7]day
Freedom never does do what she doesn’t want to
Freedom never has to [C]pay

\sloka
Freedom is her name and freedom is her nature
Running all around the town
Ev’rybody wants to and ev’rybody tries to
But nobody can hold her down
Freedom is so kind and freedom is so gentle
Freedom is a happy day
Freedom what would you do if I say "I love you"
Freedom would you run away

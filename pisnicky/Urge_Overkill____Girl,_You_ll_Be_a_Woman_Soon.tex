[Emi]Girl, [A]you’ll be a [D]woman… [G]soon

\sloka
I [Emi]love you so much, can’t count all the ways
I’ve died for you girl and all they can say is
"[D]He’s not your kind"
They [Emi]never get tired of putting me down
And I’ll never know when I come around
[D]What I’m gonna find
Don’t let them [C]make up your mind
Don’t you know…

Girl, you’ll be a woman soon

Girl, you’ll be a woman soon
Soon, you’ll need a man

\sloka
I’ve been misunderstood for all of my life
But what they’re saying girl it cuts like a knife
"The boy’s no good"
Well I’ve finally found what I’m a looking for
But if they get their chance they’ll end it for sure
Surely would
Baby I’ve done all I could
Now it’s up to you…

Girl, you’ll be a woman soon
Please, come take my hand
Girl, you’ll be a woman soon
Soon, you’ll need a man

\ref
Girl, you’ll be a woman soon
Please, come take my hand
Girl, you’ll be a woman soon
Soon but soon, you’ll need a man

\pisen{Terry Jacks}{Seasons in the Sun}

\sloka
Goodbye to you, my trusted [C]friend
We’ve known each other since we’re [Dmi]nine or ten
Together we climbed hills or [C]trees
Learned of love and AB[Dmi]C’s
[G7]skinned our hearts and skinned our [C]knees
\oddel
Goodbye my friend, it’s hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
Pretty girls are everywhere
Think of me and I’ll be there

\ref
We had [C]joy, we had fun, we had [Dmi]seasons in the sun
But the [G7]hills that we climbed
Were just seasons out of [C]time

\sloka
Goodbye, Papa, please pray for me
I was the black sheep of the family
You tried to teach me right from wrong
Too much wine and too much song
Wonder how I get along
\oddel
Goodbye, Papa, it’s hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
Little children everywhere
When you see them I’ll be there

\ref
We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song
like the seasons, all have gone

\sloka
Goodbye, Michelle, my little one
You gave me love and helped me find the sun
And every time that I was down
You would always come around
And get my feet back on the ground
\oddel
Goodbye, Michelle, it’s hard to die
When all the bird are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
With the flowers everywhere
I wish that we could both be there

\ref
We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun
But the stars we could reach
Were just starfishs on the beach

\sloka
[E7]You keep saying you’ve got something for me
Something you call love, but confess
[A7]You’ve been messing where you shouldn’t be messing
And now [E7]someone else is getting all your best

These [G]boots are made for [E]walking
And [G]that’s just what they’ll [E]do
[G]One of these day these [E]boots are gonna
Walk all over you

\sloka
You keep lying when you ought to be truthing
And you keep losing when you ought to not bet
You keep sameing when you ought to be a-changing
Now what’s right is right but you ain’t been right yet

These boots…

\sloka
You keep playing where you shouldn’t be playing
And you keep thinking that you’ll never get burned, ha!
I just found me a brand new box of matches
And what he knows you ain’t had time to learn

These boots…

Are you ready, boots? Start walking!

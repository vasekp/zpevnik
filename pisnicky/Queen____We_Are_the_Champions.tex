\sloka
I’ve paid my [Cmi]dues
[Gmi]Time after [Cmi]time
[Gmi]I’ve done my [Cmi]sentence
[Gmi]But comitted no [Cmi]crime
[B]And bad [Eb]mistakes
[Ab]I’ve made a [Eb]few
[Ab]I’ve had my [Eb]share of sand [B]kicked in my [Cmi]face
But [F]I’ve come [B]through [C]

\ref
[F]We are the [Ami]champions, my [Dmi]friend [B C]
And [F]we’ll keep on [Ami]fighting ’till the [B]end [D]
[Gmi]We are the [C]champions, [Bmi]we are the [A7]champions!
[F]No time for [Cmi7]losers
’Cause [Ab]we are [B]the champions [Cmi]of the [Fmi]world [B Fmi B]

\sloka
I’ve taken my bows and my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it’s been no bed of roses, no pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the human race
And I never lose

\ref
We are the champions…

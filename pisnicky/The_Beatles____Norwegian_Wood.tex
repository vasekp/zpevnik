\pisen{The Beatles}{Norwegian Wood}

\sloka
[D]I once had a girl, or should I say [C]she once [G]had [D]me?
She showed me her room, isn’t it good, [C]Norwe[G]gian [D]wood?
She [Dmi]asked me to stay and she told me to sit any[G]where
But [Dmi]I looked around and I noticed there wasn’t a [Emi]chair [A]

\sloka
I sat on a rug biding my time, drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said "it’s time for bed"
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn’t and crawled off to sleep in the bath

\sloka
And when I awoke I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isn’t it good, Norwegian wood?

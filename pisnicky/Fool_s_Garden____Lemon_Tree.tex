\pisen{Fool’s Garden}{Lemon Tree}

\sloka
I’m [Dmi]sitting here in a [Ami]boring room
It’s [Dmi]just another rainy Sunday [A7]afternoon
I’m [Dmi]wasting my time I got [Ami]nothing to do
I’m [Gmi]hanging around and I’m [A7]waiting for you
But [Gmi]nothing ever happens – [A7]and I [Dmi]wonder [Ami Dmi]

\sloka
I’m driving around in my car
I’m driving too fast and I’m driving too far
I’d like to change my point of view
I feel so lonely, I’m waiting for you
But nothing ever happens – and I wonder

\ref
I [F]wonder how, I [C]wonder why
[Dmi]Yesterday you told me ’bout the [Ami]blue blue sky
And [B]all that I can [C]see is just a yellow [F]lemon tree [C]
I’m [F]turning my head [C]up and down
I’m [Dmi]turning turning turning turning [Ami]turning around
And [B]all that I can [C]see is just a yellow [F]lemon tree

\sloka
[Dmi Ami Dmi Ami Gmi A7 Dmi Ami Dmi]…

\sloka
I’m sitting here, I miss the power
I’d like to go out, taking a shower
But there’s a heavy cloud inside my head
I feel so tired, put myself into bed
Where nothing ever happens – and I wonder

\hvezda
[A7]Isolation – [Dmi]it’s not good for me
[C]Isolation – [F]I don’t [B]want to [A7]sit on a lemon tree

\sloka
I’m steppin’ around in a desert of joy
Baby anyhow I’ll get another toy
And everything will happen – and you’ll wonder

\ref
I wonder why…

Is just a yellow [F]lemon tree

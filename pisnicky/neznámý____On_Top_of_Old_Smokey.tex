\pisen{}{On Top of Old Smokey}

\sloka
[G7]On top of Old [C]Smokey
All covered with [G]snow
I lost my true [D7]lover
For courting too [G]slow

\sloka
Now, courting is a pleasure
And parting is grief
And a false-hearted lover
Is worse than a thief

\sloka
A thief will just rob you
And take what you have
But a false-hearted lover
Will lead you to the grave

\sloka
And the grave will decay you
And turn you to dust;
Not one girl in a hundred
A poor boy can trust

\sloka
They’ll hug you and kiss you
And tell you more lies
Than the crossties on the railroad
Or stars in the sky

\sloka
So, come all you young maidens
And listen to me
Never place your affection
On a green willow tree

\sloka
For the leaves they will wither
And the roots they will die
You’ll all be forsaken
And never know why

\sloka
On top of Old Smokey
All covered with snow
I lost my true lover
For courting too slow
